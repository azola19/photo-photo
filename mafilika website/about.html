                     Lindeka Qampi was born in 1969 in Bolotwa, South Africa, and currently lives and works in Khayelitsha,<br> a township near Cape Town.
                     A street photographer, Qampi first learned the elements of photography through <br> a consortium of photographers known as Iliso Labantu 
                     in 2006. Her work captures the most significant aspects <br> of daily township life of which she is a part from the private sphere to the 
                     euphoria of play. <br>
                     She has documented everyday life from different townships around Cape Town, focusing on a variety of issues:<br>
                     the limited availability of land, cultural differences, creativity, awareness of cultural norms, the value of a shared history,<br>
                 
                     and, most recently, township fashion. Qampiâ€™s photographs are unselfconsciously optimistic, delighting in the vitality of <br>pleasures
                      known and shared by all. <br>
                    <br>
                     Qampi has shown her work in exhibitions in South Africa and abroad, including at the Gordon Institute for Performing and <br> Creative Arts, 
                     University of Cape Town (2013), Erdmann Contemporary, Cape Town (2013),among others.<br>


                    In 2015, Qampi decided it was time to turn her lens onto herself and her immediate family after she had penned a poem,<br>
                    "Inside My Heart", to her late mother that said. Qampi also proceeded with the idea to illustrate each word of the poem with <br> a
                     photograph, either with an image of herself or her children.


           

                   As the series developed through her exploration of self-<br>portraiture, Qampi also decided to investigate other modes of expression.
                   "Inside My Heart" now includes a video work,<br> drawings and objects made by the artist. Qampi has also developed her own singing 
                  voice and wrote the lyrics and music<br> for songs she performs when presenting this particular series.
